# [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string)

## 1. Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## 2. Solutions

### Solution 1: `Language: C` Two Pointers

One pointer is from the start of the array, and another one is from the end. Swap values and move these pointers to the next one.

- *Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 48.10% of C online submissions for Reverse String.*
- *Memory Usage: 12.4 MB, less than 15.11% of C online submissions for Reverse String.*

```C
void reverseString(char* s, int sSize) {
    int head = 0;
    // The last element of string is '\0'.
    int tail = sSize - 1;
    while (head < tail) {
        // Swapping two characters.
        int temp = s[head];
        s[head] = s[tail];
        s[tail] = temp;
        head++;
        tail--;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: `Language: Python` One Line with an Inbuilt Method

It is the best method when working, but the worst crap for learning.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s.reverse()
```
