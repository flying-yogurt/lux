## [2278. Percentage of Letter in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-letter-in-string/)

### 1. Description

Given a string `s` and a character `letter`, return the ***percentage*** of characters in `s` that equal `letter` ***rounded down*** to the nearest whole percent.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "foobar", letter = "o"
Output: 33
Explanation:
The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "jjjj", letter = "k"
Output: 0
Explanation:
The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `letter` is a lowercase English letter.
