# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

## 1. Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## 2. Solutions

### Solution 1: `Language: C` Bitwise Operations

We have `XOR` bitwise operations as following
$$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    0 \oplus 0 = 0 \\
    0 \oplus 1 = 1 \\
    1 \oplus 0 = 1 \\
    1 \oplus 1 = 0
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
and for example $3 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 5 = 5$.

int singleNumber(int *nums, int numsSize) {
    int single = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        single ^= nums[i];
    }
    return single;
}
