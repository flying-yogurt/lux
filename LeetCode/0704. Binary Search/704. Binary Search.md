## [709. To Lower Case](https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case)

### 1. Description

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with $O(\log n)$ runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + ((r - l) >> 1);
            if nums[mid] < target:
                l = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1
```
