## [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### 1. Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: C` Iteration Solution

This problem could be solved iteratively by three pointers: `prev`, `curr` and `succ`. Update the `next` pointer for every node in the linked list, and then return the new head `prev` pointer. Refer to the diagram below.

```C
/*
Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    struct ListNode *next;
};
*/

// Use 3 pointers to update the linked list.
// Refer to the diagram.
struct ListNode *reverseList(struct ListNode *head) {
    struct ListNode *prev = NULL;
    struct ListNode *curr = head;
    struct ListNode *succ = NULL;
    while (curr != NULL) {
        succ = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = succ;
    }
    // Now the pointer `prev` is the new head.
    return prev;
}
```
