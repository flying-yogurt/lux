### 1. Description

<details open>
    <summary><b>SQL Schema:</b></summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee (id int, salary int)
TRUNCATE TABLE Employee
INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary)
    VALUES ('1', '100')
INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary)
    VALUES ('2', '200')
INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary)
    VALUES ('3', '300')
```

</details>

**Table:** `Employee`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+

id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: SQL`

Note if there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`. This means we have to return a table that contains the value `null`. That is why we need an outer `SELECT ... AS ...`.
