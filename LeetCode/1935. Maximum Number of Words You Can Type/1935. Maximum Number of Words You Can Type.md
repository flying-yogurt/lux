## [1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-you-can-type/)

### 1. Description

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string `text` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string `brokenLetters` of all **distinct** letter keys that are broken, return the **number of words** in `text` you can fully type using this keyboard.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`
- `text` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
- Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
- `brokenLetters` consists of **distinct** lowercase English letters.

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: Python` Python `split()` Method

`n` is the length of list `text`, and `m` is the length of list `brokenLetters`, which has the maximum length 26. So the time complexity is the product of a constant and `n`. So the time complexity is $O(n)$.

        words = text.split(' ')
        available = len(words)
        for word in words:
            for letter in brokenLetters:
                if letter in word:
                    available -= 1
                    ## Check each word once with each letter in brokenLetters.
                    break
        return available
```
