# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

## 1. Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`

### Solution 1: `Language: Java` Dynamic Programming

- Wednesday, 10 November, 2021
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$
- *Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Climbing Stairs.*
- *Memory Usage: 35.4 MB, less than 98.39% of Java online submissions for Climbing Stairs.*

```Java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;

        int dp[] = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;

        for (int i = 3; i < n + 1; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
