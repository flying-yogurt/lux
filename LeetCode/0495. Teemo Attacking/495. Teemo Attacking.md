# [495. Teemo Attacking](https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking)

## 1. Description

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More formally, an attack at second `t` will mean Ashe is poisoned during the **inclusive** time interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`. If Teemo attacks again **before** the poison effect ends, the timer for it is **reset**, and the poison effect will end `duration` seconds after the new attack.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer duration.

Return the **total** number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= timeSeries.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 10^7`
- timeSeries is sorted in non-decreasing order.
