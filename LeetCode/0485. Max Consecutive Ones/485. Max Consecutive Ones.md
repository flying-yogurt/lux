## [485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)

### 1. Description

Given a binary array `nums`, return *the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

        if (nums[i] == 1) {
            cur_consec++;
            max_consec = cur_consec > max_consec ? cur_consec : max_consec;
        } else {
            cur_consec = 0;
        }
    }
    return max_consec;
}
