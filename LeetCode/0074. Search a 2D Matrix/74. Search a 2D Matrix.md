## [74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

### 1. Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**

![](74_example_1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](74_example_2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4`

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: Python` $O(\log(mn))$ Binary Search by treating is as 1D Array

We could treat the 2D matrix as 1D one by creating a new list. However, we could use `value = matrix[mid // col][mid % col]` inplace directly that no need to waste extra space creating a 1D array. Then, we use the binary search to find if there is the target we want.

class Solution_One(object):
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        seq = []
        row = len(matrix)

        for i in range(row):
            seq += matrix[i]

        l = 0
        r = len(seq) - 1

        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if seq[mid] == target:
                return True
            elif seq[mid] < target:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1

        return False
```

#### Solution 2: `Language: Python` $O(\log(mn))$ Twice Binary Search

In this solution, I used the binary search twice. First one is using to searching the column, and the second one searching the row we found in the first searching operation.

The time complexity is
$$O(\log m) + O(\log n) = O(\log m + \log n) = O(\log{m \times n})$$
which is equal to our first solution.
