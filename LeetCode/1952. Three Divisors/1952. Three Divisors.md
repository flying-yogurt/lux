# [1952. Three Divisors](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-divisors/)

## 1. Description

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` has **exactly three positive divisors**. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `m` is a **divisor** of `n` if there exists an integer `k` such that `n = k * m`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- $1 \leq n \leq 10^{4}$

## 2. Solutions

### Solution 1: `Language: C` ðŸ¥° Pure Mathematics

Any number greater than 1 has at least two factors, one and itself (for 1, obviously only one factor). So We need to check if there is the third factor but NOT the fourth one. How could that be? Factors always exist as a pair, except the integer square root. If we could prove that the square root of the given number is the only possible third factor, we could show that `isThree()` returns true.

Therefore, we do not need to care if the number has other factors besides its square root because it could only show as a pair. It would make an at-least-4-factors number. However, that square root must be prime; otherwise, the factors of the square root would also be the factor of the given number.

Prime is a number that has only one and itself as a factor. So the product of two primes, $p$ and &q& would has four factors: $1$, $p$, $q$, and $p \times q$. If and only if $p = q$, we could have a 3-factors number.

In conclusion, we need to check two statements:
1. The square of the given number is an integer;
2. The square of the given number is a prime number.
