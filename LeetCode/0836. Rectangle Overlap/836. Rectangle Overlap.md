## [836. Rectangle Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/)

### 1. Description

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is **positive**. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`, return `true` if they overlap, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `rect1.length == 4`
- `rect2.length == 4`
- `-10^9 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 10^9`
- `rec1` and `rec2` represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.
