## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

### 1. Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a **cycle** in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.**

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![](141_example_1.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![](141_example_2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](141_example_3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- pos is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: C` Fast and Slow Pointers

If here is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer would catching the slow one from behind. We need to make sure that `fast != NULL` and `fast->next != NULL`, cause we put `fast = fast->next->next` in the last iteration.
