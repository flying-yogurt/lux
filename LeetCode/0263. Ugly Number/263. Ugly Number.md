## [263. Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/)

### 1. Description

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

**Constraints:**

- $-2^{31} \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1$
