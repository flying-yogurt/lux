## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### 1. Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** **one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: C` Brute Force

For every number in the array, try to find the corresponding number which equals to `target - number`.

- Space Complexity: $O(1)$
- *Runtime: 128 ms, faster than 71.18% of C online submissions for Two Sum.*
- *Memory Usage: 6.7 MB, less than 31.87% of C online submissions for Two Sum.*

```C
// Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
int *twoSum(int *nums, int numsSize, int target, int *returnSize) {
    *returnSize = 2;
    // Create an empty array by the size given. In this problem, the length of
    // returned array should be always "2".
    int *output = (int *)malloc((*returnSize) * sizeof(int));
    // Locate the first number to find if there is another one.
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        int diff = target - nums[i];
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numsSize; j++) {
            if (nums[j] == diff) {
                // `i <= j;` should be always True.
                output[0] = i;
                output[1] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    // Return a pointer to the output array.
    return output;
}
```

### 3. Notes

- Because we could always find exactly one solution, so there is no need to check boundary cases.
- However, for more typical cases, the function might return an empty array.
- `break;` might be helpful for boundary cases.
- **Question: How to check if the returned array is empty?**
