## [237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

### 1. Description

Write a function to **delete a node** in a singly-linked list. You will **not** be given access to the `head` of the list, instead you will be given access to **the node to be deleted** directly.

It is **guaranteed** that the node to be deleted is **not a tail node** in the list.

**Example 1:**

![](img/leetcode_237_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

![](img/leetcode_237_node_2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4], node = 3
Output: [1,2,4]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [0,1], node = 0
Output: [1]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: head = [-3,5,-99], node = -3
Output: [5,-99]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`;
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`;
- The value of each node in the list is **unique**;
- The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail node**.

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: C` Replacement and `free()`

> The usual way of deleting a node `node` from a linked list is to modify the `next` pointer of the node *before* it, to point to the node *after* it.

> Since we do not have access to the node *before* the one we want to delete, we cannot modify the *next* pointer of that node in any way. Instead, we have to replace the value of the node we want to delete with the value in the node after it, and then delete the node after it.

> Because we know that the node we want to delete is not the tail of the list, we can guarantee that this approach is possible.

For any pointer which would not use again, the `free()` command is required case by case. Check it every time.
