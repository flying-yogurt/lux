## [83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

### 1. Description

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list **sorted** as well.

**Example 1:**

![](83_example_1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

![](83_example_2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

struct ListNode *deleteDuplicates(struct ListNode *head){
    struct ListNode *curr = head;
    while (curr != NULL && curr->next != NULL) {
        if (curr->val == curr->next->val) {
            curr->next = curr->next->next;
        } else {
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```
