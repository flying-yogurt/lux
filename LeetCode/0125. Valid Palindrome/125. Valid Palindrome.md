## [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

### 1. Description

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

**Note:** For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

### 2. Solutions

#### Solution 1: `Language: C` Two Pointers

> The resulting algorithm is simple:
>
> - Set two pointers, one at each end of the input string
> - If the input is palindromic, both the pointers should point to equivalent characters, at all times.
>   - If this condition is not met at any point of time, we break and return early.
> - We can simply ignore non-alphanumeric characters by continuing to traverse further.
> - Continue traversing inwards until the pointers meet in the middle.

```C
// isalnum() checks whether the argument is an alphanumeric character or not.
// tolower() convert the argument to a lowercase character.
bool isPalindrome(char *s) {
    int head = 0;
    int tail = strlen(s) - 1;
    while (head < tail) {
        // Check the condition `head < tail` to avoid the runtime error.
        while (head < tail && !isalnum(s[head])) {
            head++;
        }
        // Check the condition `head < tail` to avoid the runtime error.
        while (head < tail && !isalnum(s[tail])) {
            tail--;
        }
        if (tolower(s[head]) != tolower(s[tail])) {
            return false;
        }
        head++;
        tail--;
    }
    return true;
}
