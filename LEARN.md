## Lux: My Computing Science Study Voyage - Learning

This repository contains my learning notes, most related to computer science and mathematics, but other aspects such as physics and psychology have also been learned and noted.

I also attached my thought on problems on LeetCode, just for exercising and practising. `C`, `Python` and `Java` are my preferable languages.
