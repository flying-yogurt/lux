## Lux: My Computing Science Study Voyage - Learning

This repository contains my learning notes, most related to computer science and mathematics, but other aspects, such as physics and psychology, have also been learned and noted.

I also attached my thought on problems on LeetCode, just for exercising and practising. `C`, `Python` and `Java` are my preferable languages. I also write some `SQL` codes for practice; they will be pushed in the future.

Please feel free to raise some suggestions, advice, and questions. I would be grateful if my study experience could help you, and I also appreciate your help.

For the table of contents, you could visit the [README file](https://github.com/flying-yogurt/Lux/blob/master/README.md) to find helpful links. I understand this repository might need more punishment, and I will try my best to share my experience with the starter when I am available.
