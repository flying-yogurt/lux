In this lab exercise, you need to finish the following to-do list:

1. Install Python 3 (Version >= 3.8.0) on your own machine.
2. Install VS Code (Version >= 1.58.0), and ensure these extensions are correctly installed on your computer. Otherwise, you could obtain them from the Marketplace:
    - [ ] `Python` from *Microsoft*
    - [ ] `Jupyter` from *Microsoft*
    - [ ] `Pylance` from *Microsoft*

    These extensions are my personal recommended:
    - [ ] `Trailing Spaces` from *Shardul Mahadik*
    - [ ] `Code Spell Checker` from *Street Side Software*
    - [ ] `Rainbow Brackets` from *2gua*
3. Install Jupyter Notebook and try to learn some basic operations by yourself. E.g. You need to know how to create a new notebook and execute Python codes.
4. Learn to use the Terminal to operate your system without moving the mouse.
5. Use `pip3 install [package]` to install the following packages:
    - [ ] numpy
    - [ ] pandas
    - [ ] scipy
    - [ ] jupyter
    - [ ] matplotlib
6. Try to use the Markdown text format. You will need to create a new file called `Questions.md` and commit it to your own GitHub repository. In this file, you should contain following contents:
